Here’s an outline for a **High-Level Design (HLD)** and **Low-Level Design (LLD)** document for the **PDFGPT** project, covering the main architecture, module descriptions, data flow, and important interactions.

# PDFGPT Design Document

---

## 1. **Introduction**

**Project Name**: PDFGPT  
**Objective**: Enable users to upload PDF documents and interact with them using natural language queries to extract information, summaries, or insights.

---

## 2. **High-Level Design (HLD)**

### 2.1 **System Architecture**

The system follows a client-server architecture:
- **Frontend**: Built using React, TypeScript, and Vite, it handles the user interface and sends requests to the backend.
- **Backend**: Implemented with FastAPI, it handles PDF processing and natural language processing requests.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL stores metadata, user sessions, and query history.
- **Natural Language Processing**: LangChain is integrated within the backend to handle document queries, content extraction, and summarization.

### 2.2 **Component Diagram**

- **Frontend (Client)**
  - **Upload Component**: Allows users to upload PDF files.
  - **Chat Interface**: Provides an interactive interface for natural language querying.
  - **Results Display**: Shows responses, summaries, or extracted information from PDFs.

- **Backend (API)**
  - **File Handling Module**: Validates and stores uploaded files temporarily.
  - **NLP Processing Module**: Uses LangChain to process queries against the PDF content.
  - **Database Access Layer**: Interfaces with PostgreSQL to save or retrieve user sessions and query histories.

### 2.3 **Data Flow**

1. **Upload Process**:
   - User uploads a PDF through the frontend.
   - PDF is sent to the backend and validated by the file-handling module.
   
2. **Query Processing**:
   - User submits a natural language query.
   - Query is processed by LangChain, extracting relevant information from the PDF.
   - Response is sent back to the frontend and displayed.

3. **Data Storage**:
   - PostgreSQL stores query history, metadata about uploaded PDFs, and user session details.

## 3. **Low-Level Design (LLD)**

### 3.1 **Frontend Components (React)**

- **Upload Component**
  - **Props**: `onUploadSuccess`, `onUploadFailure`
  - **Functions**:
    - `handleFileUpload()`: Validates and sends the file to the backend.
    - `displayUploadStatus()`: Updates UI based on upload status.

- **Chat Interface Component**
  - **State Variables**: `query`, `response`
  - **Functions**:
    - `handleQuerySubmit()`: Sends user query to backend.
    - `displayResponse()`: Updates UI with the backend response.

### 3.2 **Backend Modules (FastAPI)**

- **File Handling Module**
  - **Endpoints**:
    - `POST /upload`: Accepts file uploads, validates PDF format, and temporarily stores the file.
  - **Functions**:
    - `validate_file(file)`: Checks if the file is a valid PDF.

- **NLP Processing Module**
  - **Dependencies**: LangChain library
  - **Functions**:
    - `process_query(query, pdf_content)`: Uses LangChain to process the natural language query.
    - `extract_content(file_path)`: Parses and extracts text from PDF.

- **Database Access Layer**
  - **Functions**:
    - `store_query_history(user_id, query, response)`: Saves each query and response in the PostgreSQL database.
    - `retrieve_history(user_id)`: Retrieves a user's query history.

### 3.3 **Database Schema (PostgreSQL)**

- **Tables**:
  - `users`: Stores user information (ID, username, etc.).
  - `pdf_documents`: Metadata for each PDF (ID, user_id, upload_date, file_path).
  - `queries`: Each user query, with fields like query text, timestamp, and PDF ID.

## 4. **Sequence Diagrams**

### 4.1 **PDF Upload Sequence**

1. **Frontend**: User selects a file and clicks upload.
2. **Backend**: `POST /upload` endpoint is called; file is validated and temporarily stored.
3. **Response**: Success or failure response is sent back to the frontend.

### 4.2 **Query Processing Sequence**

1. **Frontend**: User submits a query in the chat interface.
2. **Backend**: Query is passed to LangChain, which processes it against the PDF content.
3. **Backend**: Result is stored in `queries` table.
4. **Response**: Processed information or summary is returned to the frontend.

---

## 5. **Error Handling**

- **File Upload**: If file validation fails, return an error message.
- **Database Connection**: Check and handle database connectivity issues with retries.
- **Query Processing**: Limit query length and handle invalid queries gracefully with error messages.

---

## 6. **Future Improvements**

- **User Authentication**: Add login/registration.
- **Enhanced NLP**: Implement more advanced language models.
- **Additional File Support**: Support for other document types (e.g., Word, Excel).
